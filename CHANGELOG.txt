Version: 0.3.0
The Allocators Revolution
---------------------------------

Created some allocators that you can use to control memory as needed.
These include:
- A Bump allocator (control a fixed memory region, doesn't expand)
- An Arena allocator (linearly increase it's memory used, can only free the entire region, automatically expands when full)

Moreover you can use the generic Allocator version both to hold these allocators, but also implement your own!

Created a globally accessible arena allocator (called "temporary_arena"), used for temporary memory storage.
You can learn more how it works and how to use it inside allocators.h

Since allocators control memory we've integrated them into Array.
By default Array will use the temporary arena. 
If you want your arrays to keep memory for longer periods of time you can creat them with different allocators.
You'll see an usage example inside allocators.h
Because of this **we've removed FixedArray**, because you can simply create an array with a Bump Allocator to have an equivalent Fixed array.
We've obviously made this simple to do with new methods, more on that later.

TODO: give an example of how to use allocators
TODO: give an example of how to make new custom allocators
TODO: give an example of how to use temporary allocator
TODO: remove fixed array
TODO: make_array where it creates an arena automatically given the initial size
TODO: make_array_fixed where it creates automatically a bump given the size of the array

BREAKING CHANGES:
- in print, char* are now printed as pointers instead of strings (you have to cast them to const char* to print them as strings).
- in str, str_to_c_string returns a const char* instead of a char*.

NEW: win64_basic.h:
    created this file to hold basic and common windows functions.
    moved win64_print_error from win64_files.h into this file.
    created win64_alloc to allocate memory.
    created win64_free to free memory.

first.h:
    fixed print incorrectly printing percentages if they're the last thing to be print.
        print("%\\%", 20); would print "20\%" instead of "20%".

    improved print to tell you if you've added more % than inputs to print.
        print("% % %", 20); would print "20 % %", now it will print "20 (missing input) (missing input)".

    improved print to tell you if you've added more inputs than %.
        print("%", 20, 30, 40) would print "20", now it will print "20(extra inputs given)".

    pointers are now written like "0x0232_40C0_D8D8" (previously it would be printed like "0x0000023240C0D8D8")

math.h:
    Fixed wrong calculations for matrix functions perspective(...) and ortho(...).
    Fixed wrong calculations for mat4_determinant(...) and mat4_inverse(...).

str.h:
    Added str_count(...) to count how many times a character is inside a string

Version: 0.2.0 2024/02/15
---------------------------------

BREAKING CHANGES (read below for more info): 
- ASSERT_BOUNDS changed
- defer macro changed
- print2 removed
- array_add renamed to array_insert
- array_free_all renamed to array_free

NEW: fixed_array.h
An array of fixed size with bounds checking, basically Array without automatic expansion.

first.h:
    Removed print2, since it wasn't used by pratically anyone.
    Changed ASSERT_BOUNDS macro to be start + length instead of start to end, you shouldn't notice any change for array bounds, but you might for variables.
    
    Changed ASSERT macro to return the expression, so it can be used inside if statements. When asserts are deactivated it will be compiled into the expression, so protective checks will still work.
    You can use it like this:
    if(!ASSERT(index <= array_size)) return;
    // ...
    array[index] = value;
    
    If asserts are deactivated this will be transformed into
    if(!(index <= array_size)) return;
    meaning the check will still apply.
    
    Improved security of Array, str, StrBuilder and StrParser when ASSERT is deactivated.
    
    Improved defer macro in 2 ways:
        1. There were some cases where the code would complain about input variables not being const, this is no more the case
        2. Syntax has been updated to avoid parenthesis, the new syntax is as follows:
        defer {
            // your multiline code
        }; <- remember the ending comma!
        
        defer { free(ptr); };

dynamic_array.h:
    Array can be directly printed with out print(). Will be formatted in a single line. You can change how this works by changing the printsl_custom implementation
    Renamed array_add to array_insert and array_free_all to array_free for clarity/brevity.
    Added array_pop and array_dequeue so you can use this as a stack/queue.
    
    Now you don't have to call make_array at the start, if you construct the array with empty data it will get automatically filled later.
    This means that you can now do:
        Array<int> a;
        array_append(&a, 20);
    Instead of
        Array<int> a = make_array();
        array_append(&a, 20);
    Meaning you don't need to setup the array before using it.
    
    Fixed array_insert not working if you wanted to append something
    
Version: 0.1.4 2023/11/04
---------------------------------

dynamic_array.h:
    removed the OLDFor cycle macro, since we have the non-broken alternative For (and variants)

str.h:
    Added str_parser, a new construct to parse str and binary files.
    Added str_ends_with function (with char and str overloads) to know if a str ends with something.
    Added/Replaced str_trim with str_trim_inplace, now the _inplace version takes and edits the pointer, while the _trim version returns a new str.
    Added unicode_utf8_to_codepoint(...) function
    Added custom str_builder_append overloads for vec2, vec3 and vec4
    Added custom str_builder_append_raw overloads for vec2, vec3 and vec4
    
    Fixed some functions using printf instead of snprintf (the platform independent alternative).
    Changed unicode_utf8_to_size(...) and unicode_codepoint_to_size(...) to return s8 instead of u8, this leads to more performant code when used in array access (and since the returned value is always 1 to 4 it's simply a preferable choice)
    
win64_files.h:
    Added win64_print_error() to quickly print any error that happened duinr windows api calls.
    Added get_drive_names to know your drives names.
    Added get_only_files_in_dir to know which folders are in a directory.
    Fixed get_only_files_in_dir and get_only_folders_in_dir failing when interacting with files used by other processes, now they simply get skipped since we can't get their attributes.
    Minor change of function signature for get_only_files_in_dir and get_only_folders_in_dir, now they take a str as folder_path instead of const char* (const char* get converted automatically to str so you shouldn't notice any change).

math.h:
    Added vec2, vec3, vec4 and col constructor, so it will be automatically cast variables to float (e.g. `int a = 4;  vec2 b = {a, a*2};`).
    Added vec4 * mat4 and mat4 * vec4 operations.
    Added vecN / vecN operations ({1, 5, 3} / {2, 6, 7} == {1 / 2, 5 / 6, 3 / 7}).
    Added overload of function ortho(...) with default near and far planes (equal to glm's ortho).
    Improved vec4 remap function to use SIMD.
    Changed count_digits(...) to return u8 instead of int.
    Fixed potential bugs in lerp macro caused by missing parenthesis.
    Fixed potential bug due to types mismatch check in npow(...).

first.h:
    Fixed a bug in the `count_digits` function (precision loss)
    Fixed macro redefinition warning/error for INFINITY and NAN in first.h

Version: 0.1.3 2023/10/01
---------------------------------

Added macro in first.h to automatically create basic Enums with size info, a to_string function and print compatible
Added BENCHMARK_VOID_MANY_INPUTS and BENCHMARK_MANY_INPUTS in simple_benchmark.h to test the same function with different inputs and record data on each one
Reimplemented BENCHMARK_FUNC and BENCHMARK_FUNC_VOID to run until there's been 10 seconds of no changes to the best recorded time.

Increased compatibility of __debugbreak with other systems.
Replaced usages of sprintf_s with standard function snprintf for compatibility.
Added INFINITY and NAN macros when working with float/double/f32/f64.

Fixed in gcc ASSERT macro errors about __VA_ARGS__ when used without arguments.
Fixed in gcc error about __m128 and {} in math.h.
Fixed in gcc __rdtsc error.

Version: 0.1.2 2023/09/24
---------------------------------

Fixed print for str and str_builder being printed as array of u8 instead of a string.


Version: 0.1.1 2023/09/23
---------------------------------

Defined some macros to automatically import `first.h` if you include just a single module like `math.h`.
Same thing with performance counter and `profiling_v1.h`, `simple_benchmark.h` and `simple_profiling.h`.
Some general cleaning in `profiling_v1.h` (private variables and used ANCHORS_AMT define).

first.h:
    Reimplemented print and printsl to improve performance (as of now we're about at printf speed, sometimes slightly faster).
    Renamed custom print implementations to print_custom, you should rename them also in your code.
    Added print2, a new type of print which should be faster than printf. We don't know if we'll keep it because of it's stranger usage.

simple_benchmark.h:
    Added macros BENCHMARK_COMPARE and BENCHMARK_COMPARE_VOID to quickly benchmark 2 functions with the same inputs, to know if the second one is faster or slower. You can find comments on how they work inside the module.

str.h:
    Added overloads str_builder_append() for u8, s8, u16, s16, u32, s32, u64, s64, f32, f64, char. These will convert the numbers into string representation and add it to the builder.

dynamic_array.h:
    Added array_reserve() function.

math.h:
    Added remap function, with overloads for float, vec2, vec3 and vec4.
    struct col for colors can now be printed.

Version: 0.1.0 2023/09/16
---------------------------------

First release of gyoutils. Here's most of the stuff it includes (in no particular order):

Dynamic array 'Array<T>', a simple replacement to std::vector.
Basic types s8, u8, s16, u16, s32, u32, s64, u64, f32, f64.
Max and Min values for integer types.
A quicker alternative to printf called 'print', easily extendable.
An alternative to print for single line printing, called 'printsl'.
ASSERT macro with custom message printing and debug breaking.
defer macro for memory/resource deinitialization, can be used with any code.
math functions and values (there's a lot, principal are vec2/3/4 and mat4, sin and cos using turns instead of radians making them faster than most other implementations).
Basic performance counters.
Basic function/block profiling, handling inner and recursive functions too.
Basic benchmarking, repeating a piece of code many times to analyze it's performance.
str and str_builders, a simple replacement to std::string.
windows file handling utility functions to simplify working with files.
