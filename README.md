# GyoUtils

Gyoutils is a simple C++ library used to simplify and speedup development while working in C/C++, with a focus on speed and simplicity.

Programming has become an increasingly complex, annoying and troublesome task. Meanwhile applications are becoming slower and buggier, each year requiring more and more powerful hardware. What in the past could be done by any programmer are now only possible by teams of hundreds or even thousands of persons.

We do not agree.

Programming used to be simple. Applications used to be fast. We want things to go back to the way they were.

Since hoping for things to get better is pure fantasy, we decided to create GyoUtils.

We know we won't be able to solve every problem for everyone, different projects will always have different requirements. Instead of trying to provide solutions for everyone, we're only trying to cover the most common scenarios. That's why we're building this, so you can, and should, edit the code to fit your needs.

We want you to be in control of the software. We hope this brings you in the right direction.


# How do we do that

While working on our projects we've found ourselves frequently dissatisfied with the instruments we would be using.
They would either be too slow, or too annoying to work with. So we've decided to build them ourselves.
This is the collection of those simple tools. They have frequently helped us while developing our projects.
We hope they might help you with yours.

Here's a high level view of most of the things you can find in gyoutils.
For a more comprehensive list you should look into each file.
For updates on recent changes you should look at CHANGELOG.txt.

- A new simpler alternative to printf, faster than std::cout.
- Deactivatable assert macros with custom print messages.
- A defer macro, similar to defer in go lang, useful for memory and resource management.
- Dynamic arrays, a simple faster replacement to std::vector.
- str, a simple faster replacement to std::string.
- str_builder, a simple structure to construct your strings, which also can help you when building binary files.
- A for macro which will help you during iteration over some of gyoutils structures, more powerful than c++'s range for loop.
- Simple deactivatable performance counters, for when you want to measure performance at low level, with more resolution than std::chrono.
- A simple profiling structure to help you in profiling nested/recursive functions.
- Some simple benchmarking functionality to help you test functions in a variety of cases.
- Many common math constructs, among them you can find fast versions of vec2, vec3, vec4, mat4 etc.
- Rotors, a replacement for quaternions from a branch of mathematics called Geometric Algebra, making them easier to understand and producing faster code in many cases.
- Many other powerful things.
