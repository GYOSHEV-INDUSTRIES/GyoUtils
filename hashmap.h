// API(cogno): it would be cool to have 0 as invalid index, but then the stack has 1 extra element which is wack when you iterate. We could say "each index add/remove 1" as if the array is 1-based instead of 0-based, i don't know...

    // since we want to iterate over elements using our For macro we hold them in a stack and use a second special array for hashes.
    Array<HashPair<T, U>> elements; // API(cogno): if we inline the array into ptr + size + reserved_size we can directly iterate over elements with our For macro which might be cooler
    // TODO(cogno): this ^ is a bad idea because removing elements is TERRIBLE. Instead on focusing on having ALL elements quickly, focus on removing them, then having all of them can take as much as we want, it doesn't matter. Alternatively have the whole list with a flag that tells you if it's valid and when you iterate over them skip useless ones.

    // API(cogno): a fixed size allocator would be good too but where do you hold the Bump allocator data?
    Finder* matrix_ptr; // if you don't have conflicts this fills up (and does NOT resize)
    int matrix_size;
    
    Array<Finder> solver; // if you have conflicts this fills up (and *does* resize)
    // target: fill as much matrix with as little solver as possible
    
    // PERF(cogno): if we want to make this even faster we might SOA intead of AOS. Instead of holding an array of pair/next, we hold an array of pair and an array of next (such that with an index you can get both in different arrays)
    
    // PERF(cogno): another optimization. If we convert the linked lists into arrays then iterating through a linked list is very cache friendly. The problem becomes reallocation which is basically always O(linked_list.size). If we had only 1 linked list then it might be O(1) since we can expand the allocation zone without memcpy, but we have more than 1 list, so after the block for 1 array you will definitely find a block for another one, which needs a memcpy. Now, is it better to keep the linked lists (so O(1) realloc + bad cache iteration) or to have arrays (O(n) realloc + good cache iteration) ? I think the second one because the realloc penalty is not very often at all. If you think about it you have to realloc when an entire chain gets filled, which happens basically if every other chain gets filled first. Maybe we can realloc each array all together instead of 1 at a time?

This way we don't have to move Pairs around (and so we don't have to recalculate indeces). The problem is 1) we don't have an immediate way to iterate over elements (you have to iterate and ignore free spots) and 2) it decreases cache locality so it gets slower. But since we already loose the easy iteration process we could split key/values into 2 arrays, so key + "is it free" bool in one array and values in the other.
